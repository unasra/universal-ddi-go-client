# Migrating from bloxone-go-client

`universal-ddi-go-client` is the official successor to [`bloxone-go-client`](https://github.com/infobloxopen/bloxone-go-client). The API surface, authentication model, and supported endpoints are identical — the only breaking change is the Go module path and package import prefix.

### Migration steps

1. Update your `go.mod` dependency:
```bash
go get github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client
```

2. Replace all occurrences of `github.com/infobloxopen/bloxone-go-client` with `github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client` in your Go source files.

3. Run `go mod tidy` to remove the old dependency.

All existing configuration options (`option.WithAPIKey`, `option.WithCSPUrl`, `option.WithClientName`, `option.WithDefaultTags`) remain unchanged.

### Environment Variable Changes

The environment variables have been renamed as part of this migration:

| Old (`bloxone-go-client`) | New (`universal-ddi-go-client`) |
|---|---|
| `BLOXONE_API_KEY` | `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY` |
| `BLOXONE_CSP_URL` | `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL` |

> **Note:** The `BLOXONE_*` environment variables are supported as fallbacks, but are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please update your environment to use the new `INFOBLOX_*` variable names.

# Installation

To install `universal-ddi-go-client` use `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client
```

# Usage

You can either use an aggregated client to interact with multiple Universal DDI APIs or create a client for a specific API.

#### Aggregated Client
You can use an aggregated client to interact with multiple Universal DDI APIs. The aggregated client is available in the `client` package.

Import the package in your code:

```go
import uddiclient "github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client/client"
```

To create a new API client, you can use the `NewAPIClient` function as shown below
```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient()
// Now you can access the API clients using the client object, e.g.:
dnsConfigClient := client.DNSConfigurationAPI
```

#### Specific API Client
Alternatively, you can create a client for a specific API using the API package. For example, to create a client for the DNS Configuration API:

```go
import "github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client/dnsconfig"
client := dnsconfig.NewAPIClient()
```

# Configuration

The `NewAPIClient` function accepts a variadic list of `option.ClientOption` functions that can be used to configure the client.
It requires the `option` package to be imported. You can import the package using:
```go
import "github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client/option"
```

### Client Name
The client name is used to identify the client in the logs. By default, the client name is set to `universal-ddi-go-client`. You can change this using the `option.WithClientName` option. For example:
```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithClientName("my-client"))
```

### Server URL

The default URL for the Cloud Services Portal is `https://csp.infoblox.com`. If you need to change this, you can use `option.WithCSPUrl` to set the URL. For example:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithCSPUrl("https://csp.eu.infoblox.com"))
```

You can also set the URL using the environment variable `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL`

### Authorization

An API key is required to access Universal DDI API. You can obtain an API key by following the instructions in the guide for [Configuring User API Keys](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/BloxOneCloud/35430405/Configuring+User+API+Keys).

To use an API key with Universal DDI API, you can use the `option.WithAPIKey` option. For example:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY"))
```

You can also set the API key using the environment variable `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY`

Note: The API key is a secret and should be handled securely. Hardcoding the API key in your code is not recommended.

### Default Tags

You can set default tags for all API requests using the `option.WithDefaultTags` option. For example:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithDefaultTags(map[string]string{"tag1": "value1", "tag2": "value2"}))
```
This will add the tags `tag1=value1` and `tag2=value2` to all API requests that support tags in the request body.

### Rate Limiting

The SDK includes a built-in token-bucket rate limiter that throttles outbound API requests. This prevents overwhelming the API server with too many concurrent requests, which can result in `429 Too Many Requests` or `500 Internal Server Error` responses — particularly when used with tools like Terraform that make parallel API calls.

**The rate limiter is enabled by default at 25 requests per second with a burst size of 25.** No configuration is needed for most use cases.

> **Note:** Read-only operations (`GET` requests) are excluded from rate limiting. Only mutating operations (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) are throttled.

#### Environment Variables

You can tune or disable the rate limiter using environment variables:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INFOBLOX_RATE_LIMIT` | float | `25` | Requests per second. Set to `0` to disable rate limiting. |
| `INFOBLOX_RATE_LIMIT_BURST` | int | Same as rate limit | Maximum number of requests that can be made instantly before throttling kicks in. |

```bash
# Override the default rate limit
export INFOBLOX_RATE_LIMIT=10
export INFOBLOX_RATE_LIMIT_BURST=5

# Disable rate limiting entirely
export INFOBLOX_RATE_LIMIT=0
```

#### Programmatic Configuration

You can configure the rate limiter using functional options:

```go
// Set a rate limit of 10 requests/second with a burst of 5
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithRateLimit(10, 5))

// Disable rate limiting entirely
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithRateLimitDisabled())
```

When using the aggregated client (`client.NewAPIClient`), the rate limiter is shared across all services, so the configured rate applies to the total request throughput across all API endpoints.

You can also provide a custom rate limiter implementation using `option.WithRateLimiter`:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithRateLimiter(myCustomLimiter))
```

The custom limiter must implement the `option.RateLimiter` interface:

```go
type RateLimiter interface {
    Wait(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

### Retry

The SDK automatically retries requests that fail with transient HTTP errors. This handles temporary server-side issues without requiring callers to implement their own retry logic.

**Retry is enabled by default with 3 retries, exponential backoff (1s–30s), and full jitter.** The following HTTP status codes are retried:
- `429 Too Many Requests`
- `500 Internal Server Error`
- `502 Bad Gateway`
- `503 Service Unavailable`
- `504 Gateway Timeout`

When the server returns a `Retry-After` header with a `429` response, the SDK respects the indicated wait duration (capped to the configured maximum wait).

Permanent transport errors — such as DNS `NXDOMAIN` (host not found) and invalid TLS certificates — are not retried.

#### Environment Variables

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INFOBLOX_MAX_RETRIES` | int | `3` | Maximum number of retry attempts. Set to `0` to disable retry. |
| `INFOBLOX_RETRY_MIN_WAIT` | duration | `1s` | Minimum backoff between retries. |
| `INFOBLOX_RETRY_MAX_WAIT` | duration | `30s` | Maximum backoff between retries. |

```bash
# Override retry settings
export INFOBLOX_MAX_RETRIES=5
export INFOBLOX_RETRY_MIN_WAIT=2s
export INFOBLOX_RETRY_MAX_WAIT=1m

# Disable retry entirely
export INFOBLOX_MAX_RETRIES=0
```

#### Programmatic Configuration

```go
// Custom retry settings
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithRetry(5, 2*time.Second, 1*time.Minute))

// Disable retry entirely
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithRetryDisabled())
```

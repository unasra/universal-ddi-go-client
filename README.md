- [Infrastructure Provision (HostActivation API)](infra_provision/README.md)
- [Anycast Configuration Manager](anycast/README.md)
- [Upgrade Policy](upgradePolicy/README.md)

## Infoblox Threat Defense
- [Threat Defense Cloud (FW API)](fw/README.md)
- [DNS Forwarding Proxy (DFP API)](dfp/README.md)
- [Redirect](redirect/README.md)

## Universal DDI
- [IP Address Management](ipam/README.md)
- [DNS Configuration](dns_config/README.md)

- [Keys](keys/README.md)

# Migrating from bloxone-go-client

`universal-ddi-go-client` is the official successor to [`bloxone-go-client`](https://github.com/infobloxopen/bloxone-go-client). The API surface, authentication model, and supported endpoints are identical — the only breaking change is the Go module path and package import prefix.

### Migration steps

1. Update your `go.mod` dependency:
```bash
go get github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client
```

2. Replace all occurrences of `github.com/infobloxopen/bloxone-go-client` with `github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client` in your Go source files.

3. Run `go mod tidy` to remove the old dependency.

All existing configuration options (`option.WithAPIKey`, `option.WithCSPUrl`, `option.WithClientName`, `option.WithDefaultTags`) remain unchanged.

### Environment Variable Changes

The environment variables have been renamed as part of this migration:

| Old (`bloxone-go-client`) | New (`universal-ddi-go-client`) |
|---|---|
| `BLOXONE_API_KEY` | `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY` |
| `BLOXONE_CSP_URL` | `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL` |

> **Note:** The `BLOXONE_*` environment variables are supported as fallbacks, but are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please update your environment to use the new `INFOBLOX_*` variable names.

# Installation

To install `universal-ddi-go-client` use `go get` command:

```bash
go get github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client
```

# Usage

You can either use an aggregated client to interact with multiple Universal DDI APIs or create a client for a specific API.

#### Aggregated Client
You can use an aggregated client to interact with multiple Universal DDI APIs. The aggregated client is available in the `client` package.

Import the package in your code:

```go
import uddiclient "github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client/client"
```

To create a new API client, you can use the `NewAPIClient` function as shown below
```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient()
// Now you can access the API clients using the client object, e.g.:
dnsConfigClient := client.DNSConfigurationAPI
```

#### Specific API Client
Alternatively, you can create a client for a specific API using the API package. For example, to create a client for the DNS Configuration API:

```go
import "github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client/dnsconfig"
client := dnsconfig.NewAPIClient()
```

# Configuration

The `NewAPIClient` function accepts a variadic list of `option.ClientOption` functions that can be used to configure the client.
It requires the `option` package to be imported. You can import the package using:
```go
import "github.com/infobloxopen/universal-ddi-go-client/option"
```

### Client Name
The client name is used to identify the client in the logs. By default, the client name is set to `universal-ddi-go-client`. You can change this using the `option.WithClientName` option. For example:
```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithClientName("my-client"))
```

### Server URL

The default URL for the Cloud Services Portal is `https://csp.infoblox.com`. If you need to change this, you can use `option.WithCSPUrl` to set the URL. For example:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithCSPUrl("https://csp.eu.infoblox.com"))
```

You can also set the URL using the environment variable `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_URL`

### Authorization

An API key is required to access Universal DDI API. You can obtain an API key by following the instructions in the guide for [Configuring User API Keys](https://docs.infoblox.com/space/BloxOneCloud/35430405/Configuring+User+API+Keys).

To use an API key with Universal DDI API, you can use the `option.WithAPIKey` option. For example:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY"))
```

You can also set the API key using the environment variable `INFOBLOX_PORTAL_KEY`

Note: The API key is a secret and should be handled securely. Hardcoding the API key in your code is not recommended.

### Default Tags

You can set default tags for all API requests using the `option.WithDefaultTags` option. For example:

```go
client := uddiclient.NewAPIClient(option.WithDefaultTags(map[string]string{"tag1": "value1", "tag2": "value2"}))
```
This will add the tags `tag1=value1` and `tag2=value2` to all API requests that support tags in the request body.

# Unified Nameservers

## Deprecation Notice: DNS Server Group (NSG) Assignment

As part of the Unified Nameservers initiative, the following DNS Server Group configurations are deprecated and will no longer be allowed. Requests that use them will be rejected:

- **Nested DNS Server Groups** — A DNS Server Group cannot be nested inside an authoritative DNS Server Group (AuthNSG).
- **Dual-role DNS Server Groups** — The same DNS Server Group cannot be assigned to both a primary zone and a secondary zone.
- **Multiple DNS Server Groups on an authoritative zone** — Only one DNS Server Group may be assigned to an authoritative zone (AuthZone).
- **DNS Server Groups combined with internal secondaries** — A DNS Server Group and internal secondaries cannot coexist on an authoritative zone.

Review your configurations for any of the above patterns and update them before they are enforced.
